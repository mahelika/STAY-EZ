# Wanderlust

Wanderlust is a work-in-progress web application inspired by Airbnb. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete listings for accommodations. The project is being actively developed and will include additional features over time. 

## Features

- **Create Listings**: Users can create new accommodation listings with a title, description, price, location, and image.
- **View Listings**: Users can browse available listings and view detailed information about each one.
- **Edit Listings**: Users can edit their existing listings to update details like price, location, or images.
- **Delete Listings**: Users can delete listings that they no longer need.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose for object modeling)
- **Frontend**: EJS for templating, CSS for styling
- **Authentication**: (Add any authentication methods if applicable, e.g., JWT, Passport)
- **Other Libraries**: Method-Override, EJS-Mate, etc.

This project is currently in progress, and the following features will be added:
	•	User authentication and authorization (login, registration, etc.)
	•	Search and filtering for listings
	•	User reviews and ratings for accommodations
	•	Image upload handling (e.g., using cloud services like Cloudinary)
	•	Enhanced UI and user experience improvements
